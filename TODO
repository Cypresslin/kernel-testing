Autotest
--------

 * Rebase to a newer upstream autotest version.

 * xfstests
     * Expand the xfstest to cover more than ext4. We were doing all
       filesystems we cared about but were running into a lot of
       failures.

     * Look at the failures and see which of them are failures that
       we need to be doing something about and start working them.

kernel-testing
--------------

  * Fix HWE kernel testing for non-quantal kernels.

  * Fix virtual testing. Most of the necessary infrastructure is
    in place, it just needs to be wrung out.

  * Add support for CEPH testing. This is going to require some
    custom provisioning but just builds on what we already have.

  * Need a tool/process which prunes the metrics/test-results.
